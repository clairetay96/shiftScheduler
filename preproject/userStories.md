* Just started working part time at multiple places
* Different workplaces have different methods for conveying shift preferences

As a group admin (ie shift assigner/manager), a user should be able to consolidate all worker's shift preferences, and assign shifts painlessly.

As a group member (ie shift worker), a user should be able to submit their shift preferences easily to their manager.
